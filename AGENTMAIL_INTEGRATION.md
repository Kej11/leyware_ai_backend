# AgentMail Webhook Integration

Complete implementation of AgentMail webhook integration for processing PDF game pitch attachments with AI extraction and Neon database storage.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The implementation follows a clean webhook ‚Üí process ‚Üí extract ‚Üí store flow:

```
AgentMail ‚Üí POST /webhook/agentmail ‚Üí EmailWebhookAgent ‚Üí EmailProcessingWorkflow ‚Üí Neon Database
```

## üìÅ Components Created

### 1. **PDF Extraction Tool** (`src/mastra/tools/pdf-extraction-tool.ts`)
- Downloads PDF from attachment URL
- Uses Google Gemini 2.5 Pro for structured data extraction
- Extracts comprehensive game pitch data including:
  - Core game info (title, developer, publisher, description)
  - Classification (genres, platforms, target audience)
  - Business data (monetization, funding, revenue projections)
  - Development details (stage, team size, timeline)
  - Confidence scores for extracted data

### 2. **Email Webhook Agent** (`src/mastra/agents/email-webhook-agent.ts`)
- Processes incoming AgentMail webhook payloads
- Validates event types and attachment formats
- Orchestrates PDF extraction using AI tools
- Handles errors gracefully with detailed logging

### 3. **Email Processing Workflow** (`src/mastra/workflows/email-processing-workflow.ts`)
- Three-step workflow: Validate ‚Üí Extract ‚Üí Store
- Validates webhook payload and filters PDF attachments
- Extracts data from each PDF using AI
- Prepares data for Neon database storage

### 4. **Webhook Endpoint** (`src/mastra/index.ts`)
- Registered POST `/webhook/agentmail` endpoint
- Webhook signature validation (when secret provided)
- Event filtering (only processes `message.received`)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 5. **Database Tools** (`src/mastra/tools/pitch-database-tool.ts`)
- Prepared for Neon MCP integration
- Dynamic SQL generation for pitch records
- Support for updates and inserts

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

Enhanced the existing `inbound_pitches` table with email metadata:

```sql
-- Added columns for email context
ALTER TABLE inbound_pitches 
ADD COLUMN emailFrom VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN emailSubject TEXT,
ADD COLUMN emailBody TEXT;
```

The table includes comprehensive fields for:
- Email metadata (from, subject, body)
- File information (name, path, URL, size)
- Extraction status and results
- Game data (all fields from pitch analysis)
- Review workflow (status, notes, scores)

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables (`.env.example`)
```env
# AgentMail Integration
AGENTMAIL_API_KEY=your-agentmail-api-key-here
AGENTMAIL_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret-here

# Required existing variables
NEON_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your-key
```

### Webhook URL
```
POST https://your-domain.com/webhook/agentmail
```

## üìù Usage Flow

### 1. AgentMail Webhook Event
```json
{
  "event": "message.received",
  "message": {
    "id": "msg-12345",
    "from": "developer@example.com",
    "to": "pitches@yourcompany.com",
    "subject": "Game Pitch: Epic Adventure",
    "body": "Please find attached our game pitch...",
    "attachments": [
      {
        "filename": "game-pitch.pdf",
        "contentType": "application/pdf",
        "size": 1024000,
        "url": "https://agentmail.to/download/..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Processing Steps
1. **Validation**: Check event type and PDF attachments
2. **Download**: Fetch PDF from attachment URL
3. **Extraction**: Use Gemini AI to extract game data
4. **Storage**: Store in Neon database with email context

### 3. Database Record Created
```sql
INSERT INTO inbound_pitches (
  id, organizationId, userId,
  emailFrom, emailSubject, emailBody,
  fileName, fileUrl, uploadDate,
  gameTitle, developerName, gameDescription,
  extractionStatus, extractionConfidence,
  -- ... additional fields
) VALUES (...)
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test File: `test-webhook-integration.ts`
- Mock webhook payload testing
- PDF extraction tool validation
- Workflow execution testing
- Error handling verification

### Run Tests
```bash
# Build project
pnpm build

# Run tests (when ready)
node test-webhook-integration.js
```

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### 1. AgentMail Setup
- [ ] Create AgentMail account
- [ ] Configure webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/webhook/agentmail`
- [ ] Set up API keys and webhook secret
- [ ] Test with sample emails

### 2. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Set `AGENTMAIL_API_KEY`
- [ ] Set `AGENTMAIL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Verify `NEON_DATABASE_URL` connection
- [ ] Verify `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`

### 3. Database Setup
- [ ] Confirm `inbound_pitches` table exists
- [ ] Email fields added (`emailFrom`, `emailSubject`, `emailBody`)
- [ ] Test database connectivity

### 4. Organization/User Mapping
- [ ] Implement organization mapping logic
- [ ] Set up user creation/mapping for unknown senders
- [ ] Configure default organization and user fallbacks

## üìä Monitoring & Logging

The integration includes comprehensive logging:
- Webhook receipt and validation
- PDF download and processing status
- AI extraction results and confidence scores
- Database operations success/failure
- Error details with stack traces

## üîÑ Data Flow Example

```
1. Email arrives at AgentMail inbox
2. AgentMail sends webhook to /webhook/agentmail
3. Mastra validates event and checks for PDFs
4. PDF extracted using Gemini AI:
   - Game Title: "Epic Adventure Quest"
   - Developer: "Indie Game Studio"
   - Confidence: 0.85
5. Record stored in Neon database
6. Success response returned to AgentMail
```
